    The mission for this delegate is to transfer its pay to a charity, as long
    as its goals are somewhat aligned / related to advancing the BitShares
    ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
    This can be seen as a way to indirectly improve the security
    from attack external to the system, as these organizations can be helpful
    when it comes to regulatory issues, deciding on legal status for
    running a delegate, etc.
