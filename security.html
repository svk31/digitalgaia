<p>
    The mission for this delegate is to accumulate funds until there are enough
    to perform a security audit of the client. An audit will be performed
    everytime there are enough funds.
</p>
<p>
    This is an important facet of security, because if there are no fundamental
    design flaws in the system, the only way to critically break it is through
    a software bug. Ensuring that the code is as resistant as possible to a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">black swan event</a> guarantees that the main developers can
    focus on the higher-level concepts rather than on low-level technical issues.
